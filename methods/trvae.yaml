Description: 'trVAE is conditional variational autoencoder, 
              which applies Maximum Mean Discrepancy regularization to the first layer of its decoder.
              This forces the model to learn condition-invariant features,
              enabling it to transform samples between conditions and predict OOD responses,
              such as cell-type specific response to seen perturbations. '
