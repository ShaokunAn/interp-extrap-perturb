Description: 'scDoRI is an autoencoder framework that infers enhancer-mediated gene regulatory networks (eGRNs) from single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data.
 Its encoder maps multi-omic profiles into a shared, low-dimensional (topic) space, representing each cell as a mixture of regulatory programmes.
 A mechanistically constrained four-module decoder then reconstructs distinct components of the original data.
 These modules reconstruct ATAC-seq counts to identify co-accessible peak patterns (Module 1),
 predict gene expression from chromatin accessibility and learn enhancer-gene links (Module 2),
 and model co-expressed transcription factors (TFs) via TF expression reconstruction (Module 3). 
 This information (Modules 1-3) is then integrated to reconstruct RNA counts,
 while inferring signed GRNs that distinguish between activators and repressors (Module 4). 
 The model can be optionally trained using a two-phase process: 
 an initial phase learns a robust latent space with the core reconstruction modules (1-3),
 followed by a second phase that trains the eGRN inference module (Module 4).'
