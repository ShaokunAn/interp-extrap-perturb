Description: 'STAMP is an interpretable, spatially-aware dimension reduction method
 that models the gene expression using Gamma Poisson likelihood, determined by a combination of latent topic proportions (logNormal)
 ,gene modules, and background residuals. The model employs a structured regularised horseshoe prior on the gene modules to induce sparsity.
 To incorporate spatial context, STAMP utilises a simplified graph convolutional network as its inference network.
 STAMP can be extended to handle multi-sample data by adding a batch correction term (via batch-specific loading matrices)
 and to analyse time-series data by allowing gene modules to vary over time via a Gaussian process prior.'
